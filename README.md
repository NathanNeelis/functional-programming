### Concept
Making a geographical map for parking places near train stations and inform the reader about electric charge spots and the amount of disabled spots.

### Research questions
**Main research question: Are at some cities the P+R parking area's more often paid services than in other cities?**  
**Sub question 1:** Are there more free P+R parking services outside of the Randstad?  
**Sub question 2:** Are there more paid P+R parking services inside the Randstad than free P+R services?  
**Sub question 3:** Are there more P+R parking area's near cities in the Randstad then there are P+R parking area's near cities outside the Randstad?  
**(Optional) Sub question 4:** Which P+R is the best parking spot for visiting Amsterdam?
**(Optional) Sub question 5:** Are P+R parking area's often more paid services in city's where the income of citizens is higher?
