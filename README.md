## Concept
Making a geographical map for parking places near train stations and inform the reader about electric charge spots and the amount of disabled spots.

### Research questions
**Research Question:** At which train stations are you able to park your car?  
Subquestion 1: Can you also recharge your parked car?  
Subquestion 2: Are you able to park your car if you are disabled?  

#### Asumptions
My assumption is that there is more parking space at smaller train stations.  
I believe there are only small amount of parking spots if any at all in the big cities in the Netherlands.
I also assume that the electric charge spots are about the same overall the parking spaces. I don't think there is much difference between the cities or the countryside. I do think however that there are more parking spots for disabled people outside the cities because public transport is not always that accessible to transport you to the train station.

### Datasets
[RDW dataset: GEO Parkeerkarages](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/GEO-Parkeer-Garages/t5pc-eb34)  
_Variables: Geolocations and areaid codes_  
[RDW dataset: Geometrie gebied](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-GEOMETRIE-GEBIED/nsk3-v9n7)  
_Variables: areaid, GeoDataAsText_
[RDW dataset: Specificaties parkeergebieden](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s)  
_Variables:  Areaid's, total parking spots, electric charge parking spots, disabled parking spots._  
[NS dataset: train station location](https://apiportal.ns.nl/)  
[NS dataset: parking spots?](https://apiportal.ns.nl/)  
_At this point it's unclear what is included in the NS dataset. I will update this later on._
