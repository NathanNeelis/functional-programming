## Concept
Making a geographical map for parking places near train stations and inform the reader about electric charge spots and the amount of disabled spots.

### Researsch questions
**Research Question:** At which train station are you able to park your car?  
Subquestion 1: Can you also recharge your parked car?  
Subquestion 2: Are you able to park your car if you are disabled?  

### Datasets
[RDW dataset: GEO Parkeerkarages](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/GEO-Parkeer-Garages/t5pc-eb34)  
_Variables: Geolocations and areaid codes_  
[RDW dataset: Specificaties parkeergebieden](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s)  
_Variables:  Areaid's, total parking spots, electric charge parking spots, isabled parking spots._  
[NS dataset: train station location](https://apiportal.ns.nl/)  
[NS dataset: parking spots?](https://apiportal.ns.nl/)  
_At this point its unclear what is included in the NS dataset. I will update this later on._
