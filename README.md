### Concept
I want to create a bar chart for the 9 Randstad cities. That shows the difference in paid and free P+R parking area's. And maybe, if the data is there a difference in rates. I would also like to pick out some cities outside the randstad and show the difference in paid and free P+R.
  
After that I would like so like to visualize a geographical map of all P+R parking places. I want to show a difference in paid and free. And I also want to highlight the best P+R spot to visit Amsterdam and maybe other cities.   

### Research questions
**Main research question: Are at some cities the P+R parking area's more often paid services than in other cities?**  
**Sub question 1:** Are there more free P+R parking services outside of the Randstad?  
**Sub question 2:** Are there more paid P+R parking services inside the Randstad than free P+R services?  
**Sub question 3:** Are there more P+R parking area's near cities in the Randstad then there are P+R parking area's near cities outside the Randstad?  
**(Optional) Sub question 4:** Which P+R is the best parking spot for visiting Amsterdam?
**(Optional) Sub question 5:** Are P+R parking area's often more paid services in city's where the income of citizens is higher?
